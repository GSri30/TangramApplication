# Tangram Application

## Run Commands

To run the application, run the following commands:

`npm install --global http-server`

`npm start`

## Future Scope

- To also randomize the left surface each time when a user enters mode 2, to some valid arrangement of fixed primitives.
- To add drag bars to directly specify the destination coordinates, rather than having clicks for each pixel change.
- To optimize speed of final shape in mode 3, instead of creating a downloadable url at each pixel change, dedicate a key, which upon pressing, will generate a downloadable file.
